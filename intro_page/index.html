      <div class="section-content centered">
        <p>
          Every student has felt it — the confusion, the panic, the constant
          fear of missing out on something important. You're juggling college
          lectures, projects, and side learning, while trying to hunt for
          internships, placements, or hackathons scattered across dozens of
          platforms. Google Forms from who-knows-where. Telegram links that
          disappear. WhatsApp updates that arrive too late. No filters. No
          structure. No clarity.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You don’t know which opportunity you’re eligible for. You don’t know
          where to apply. You don’t even know if something relevant has already
          slipped past. It’s not just disorganized — it’s unfair. Students waste
          time and mental energy chasing broken systems that should be helping
          them grow.
