# 🎓 Uniflow Career Portal

Uniflow Career Portal is a modern **student-focused career platform** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It provides an intuitive way for students to **sign up, create a digital career profile, and present themselves professionally** to future opportunities.  


Unlike a simple resume, Uniflow is designed as an **interactive portal** where students can highlight their **education, experience, skills, achievements, and personal interests** in a structured, engaging format.

## 🌟 Motivation & Purpose
The job and internship market is becoming **more competitive** each year. While platforms like LinkedIn exist, they can feel overwhelming for college students just starting their career journey.  

Uniflow Career Portal was built to solve this problem by:  
- ✅ Giving students a **simple yet professional platform** to showcase their journey.  
- ✅ Helping them **bridge the gap** between education and opportunities.  
- ✅ Allowing developers (like me) to **practice building real-world career portals**.  
- ✅ Simulating how large-scale professional platforms work, but tailored for **students at different stages of college**.  

This project is not just a form—it’s the **foundation of a future-ready platform** that can evolve into a full-stack career management system.
